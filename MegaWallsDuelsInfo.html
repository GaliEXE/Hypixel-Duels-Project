	<h1>Mega Walls Duels</h1>
	<p>Like Skywars Duels Megawatts duels have many types of kits you can use. These kits are obviously different than the types of kits you can get (see <a href="SkywarsDuelsInfo.html">Skywars</a>. Megawalls does not see as many players as some of the other duels and is hard to get a hand of.</p>
